# Two Pinches
A food blog for the Boston area... and beyond! I got started building this with
BrianLM's [Angular Auth template](https://github.com/BrianLM/angular-auth). This
application tracks reviews for restaurants that you have been to. It is an Angular
app that interacts with resources on an Express API.

## API Repository
https://github.com/jeffkeilman/two-pinches-api

## Technologies Used
-   Angular 5
-   Twitter Bootstrap 4/[NG-Bootstrap](https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/#/home)
-   [DOMPurify library](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify) for input sanitization
-   [Noty alerts](https://ned.im/noty)
-   [angular-cli-ghpages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular-cli-ghpages)

## Future Iterations
-   I would like to add Google Maps integration to the site and display a map under each location.
-   It would be nice to clean up the comment section. The table doesn't look very nice.
-   I want to add the ability for a user to reply to another comment.
-   I want to spend a little more time making everything generally look better. UI styling is not prime.
-   Implement real Auth Guard.
-   Add admin capabilities for comments (CRUD any comment).
-   Implement search feature for restaurants (for users).

## Planning/Development Process
I started by drawing out my entire project and writing a few user stories. I had wireframes
for the initial views I intended to have. I drew up an ERD for the back-end resources. During
the development phase, I tried to stick to the general plan I laid out on paper, but ended
up changing some components of the app as I saw fit.
